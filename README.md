# Marketing-Channel-Attribution-w-Markov-Blankets


This project seeks to use deep-learning Markov blankets to identify the ROI of the marketing channels.
Markov-blanekts have advantages over Linear TV, First Touch and Last Touch. These 3 models can oversimplify the results and lead to overconfidence, which can lead to misguided marketing decisions. 

The goal of this project is to use Markov-blankets/chains to evaluate channel attributions, and compare these results to the more traidtional: First-touch, Last-touch, Linear TV.
